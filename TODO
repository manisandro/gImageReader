High prio:
- notifier web links do not work?
- replace all
- insensitive when busy?
- Either implement blur-downscaled or remove checkbox in settings
- More elegant approach for local execution? (in common.hh)

Low prio:
- markers in buffer to find corresponding page from cursor position
- blur downscaled -> this should really be fixed in cairo

Cleanup:
- const in private member functions?


win32: uninstall previous version during setup
win32: twain, papersize
